  mission:
    m1: DNA Academy Pakistan is a platform established by young, enthusiastic, qualified and competent individuals willing to lead and promote Basic & advanced Genetic Testing tools, analytical skills and promote Research by providing theoretical and Hands on Experience.
    m2: Inspired by Mission Mars, Successful Amplification of DNA aboard the International Space Station , First DNA sequencing in space and more recently Covid-19 pandemic caused by SARS COV-2 , we have announced this forum to educate , train and polish skills and core concepts of Next generation of Molecular Pathology Technologist, Researchers and fresh graduates who are exploring most interesting and promising carriers for their future professional life.
    m3: Being a third world nation we always make excuses that we have no access to most recent technology and centers who can train and promote Science. We here made an attempt to change this concept while promoting Science and sharing knowledge and skill. Join us to learn how we can accomplish things within limited resources and get noticed by the rest of the world. All we to do are to share and trust each other. Together we can make it happen. GOOD LUCK to you and team DNA Academy Pakistan
